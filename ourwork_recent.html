            <p>"The unequal distribution of food is one of the world's most tragic facts. Millions of people die because
                they have too little to eat, and many die because they have too much".

            <h2>More About This Project</h2>
            <p>In 2018, the EPA reported that 63.1 million tonnes of food were wasted, which could have helped those
                facing food insecurity. Responding to this, Helping Hut's Teams in Dwarka and Kota distributed essential
                dry rations to vulnerable members of our society, including daily wage laborers and farmers. These
                distributions took place in Village Kharija, Rajasthan, on May 26, 2021, and near Dwarka Sector 14 metro
                station on October 31, 2021. We believe in rising together by helping others, following our motto, 'We
                rise by lifting others.'</p>

            <h2>More About This Project</h2>
            <p>In response to the Covid pandemic and the nationwide lockdown, "The Helping Hut" launched a Mask
                Distribution Drive. Recognizing the importance of masks in preventing the spread of the virus, we
                distributed 500+ masks to the underprivileged members of our society who couldn't afford them. As Prime
                Minister Narendra Modi emphasized, masks have become a symbol of a civilized society, and by focusing on
                masking, self-wellness, vaccination, and community, we can stay safe and protect one another.
