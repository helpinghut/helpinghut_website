            <h1>Weâ€™re Non-Profit Charity
                & NGO Organization</h1>
            <p>A charity carnival is an event focused on fundraising for a cause, charity, or non-profit. Rather than
                seeking personal happiness through various causes, why not derive joy from making others happy, without
                any ulterior motives or financial gain?</p>
            <h3> Support those people going through very difficult times.</h3>
            <h3>Make the world a better place</h3>
            <h3>Spread love within your community.
            </h3>

        <h2>Our Campaign</h2>
        <h1>Capturing the joy and activities of previous events</h1>
        <p>In December 2021, our organization took action to bring joy to little ones. We aimed to lift the heavy
            responsibility from their shoulders, letting them freely enjoy their childhood for a while. We organized
            games like finding coins in the sand, treasure hunts, skipping races, and more. Alongside the fun, we gave
            gifts like geometry boxes, lunchboxes, and stationery items. Food stalls with sandwiches, bhel puri, fresh
            salad, and beverages added to the enjoyment. We focused on educating homeless children and caring for their
            physical health. </p>
        <p>Seeing the joy in the kids' eyes during the games made it all worthwhile. These small steps were our way of
            bringing big smiles to their faces, steps that will surely lead to bigger strides in the future. Being part
            of this wonderful event with such lovely children and kind-hearted team members brought us great joy.</p>
