            <p>EDUCATION AWARENESS CAMPAIGN ,The higher the level of education, the less likely the person is to fall below the poverty line. This is because education imparts skills and knowledge associated with higher wages. Educating girls in particular makes them more likely to take control of decisions relating to fertility, family welfare, and health. HELPING HUT, TEAM DWARKA went down the streets of Dwarka to make people aware about the importance of education on 19th December 2021.education is the best way in which we can contribute to the nation's growth.</p>

            <p>Embracing recycling and reusing waste stands as a pivotal element in contemporary waste reduction, allowing for the optimal utilization of existing resources. Beyond its environmental benefits,all while contributing positively to society. In the face of a growing population and increasing needs, the perpetual demand for new things persists. Recycling waste emerges as a sustainable solution, mitigating environmental impact and bridging the gap between burgeoning requirements and available resources. Inspired by this ethos, our online campaign promoting 'Best Out of Waste' activities garnered enthusiastic responses, reflecting a shared commitment to sustainable living</p>

            <p>On Teacher's Day, Helping Hut collaborated with Mr. Pramod Kumar, Assistant Professor at the University of Delhi, for an awareness session. The focus: empower rural children through education for an independent and tech-driven future. Guided by mentors, the session inspired children to see life's purpose and the opportunities education brings. Volunteers made the day special, fostering mentorship. Children, with enthusiasm, created national flag drawings and took initial steps towards educationâ€”a celebration of freedom, service, and responsibility.
