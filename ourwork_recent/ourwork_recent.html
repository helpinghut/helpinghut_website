            <h2>More About This Project</h2>
            <p>In 2018, the EPA reported that 63.1 million tonnes of food were wasted, which could have helped those facing food insecurity. Responding to this, Helping Hut's Teams in Dwarka and Kota distributed essential dry rations to vulnerable members of our society, including daily wage laborers and farmers. These distributions took place in Village Kharija, Rajasthan, on May 26, 2021, and near Dwarka Sector 14 metro station on October 31, 2021. We believe in rising together by helping others, following our motto, 'We rise by lifting others.'</p>

            <h2>More About This Project</h2>
            <p>In response to the Covid pandemic and the nationwide lockdown, "The Helping Hut" launched a Mask Distribution Drive. Recognizing the importance of masks in preventing the spread of the virus, we distributed 500+ masks to the underprivileged members of our society who couldn't afford them. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasized, masks have become a symbol of a civilized society, and by focusing on masking, self-wellness, vaccination, and community, we can stay safe and protect one another.
